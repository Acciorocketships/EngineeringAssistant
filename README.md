Engineering Assistant
=====================

The engineering assistant opens as a very Mac Spotlight-esque search bar on the desktop. The user can search for directions, open an app, ask a science/engineering related question (to be solved by wolfram), solve matricies (using Matlab), or chat with the built-in GLADoS-themed chatbot. This is all done with natural language processing, so the computer can understand your intent even if you ask a question in normal speech.
